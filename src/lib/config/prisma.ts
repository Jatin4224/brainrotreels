 * WHAT:  Singleton PrismaClient cached on globalThis in dev to survive HMR,
 *        plus the shared DbClient union accepted by services that may run
 *        either inside an active tx or against the singleton.
 * WHY:   Without the global cache, Next.js dev hot-reloads create a new client
 *        on every change and the connection pool blows up; in production a
 *        fresh instance is created exactly once at module init.
 * WHERE: Re-exported from src/lib/config/index.ts and used by auth.ts,
 *        every service, and the tRPC context.
