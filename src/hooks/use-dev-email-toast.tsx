/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: useDevEmailToast
 *
 * WHAT:  Returns `notify(email)` — after an auth action, it asks the dev-only
 *        `dev.getPendingEmail` query for the link that would have been emailed
 *        (verification / reset) and, if present, shows a Sonner toast with the
 *        clickable link plus a "temporary, add your key for production" warning.
 * WHY:   With no RESEND_API_KEY in local dev, the verification/reset link would
 *        otherwise be lost. This surfaces it so the developer can proceed. The
 *        server query only returns a link in development while Resend is
 *        unconfigured, so nothing is exposed in production.
 * WHERE: Used by the sign-up form and the forgot-password form.
