/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: NAV_ICONS, getNavIcon, NavIconName
 *
 * WHAT:  Maps the `nav.icon` string on a RESOURCES entry to a lucide icon
 *        component, with a safe fallback.
 * WHY:   RESOURCES stores icons as plain strings (it must stay free of React
 *        imports). This is the single place those strings resolve to
 *        components, so adding a new nav icon means adding one map entry here.
 * WHERE: Used by src/components/global/sidebar/app-sidebar.tsx.
