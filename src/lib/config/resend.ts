 *        guards on isResendConfigured() and no-ops in that case, mirroring the

 *        is active, email verification is not enforced at sign-in and the
 *        verification link is handed to the client for a toast. Both relaxations
 *        MUST flip off together, hence one predicate rather than two — and both
 *        are impossible in production because NODE_ENV gates them.
