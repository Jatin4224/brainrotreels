/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: getStripeClient, isStripeConfigured,
 *   STRIPE_API_VERSION, getStripeWebhookSecret
 *
 * WHAT:  Lazy server-side Stripe client + config guards. Constructs the SDK on
 *        first use so a missing STRIPE_SECRET_KEY doesn't crash import/build.
 * WHY:   Billing fails soft when unconfigured (callers check isStripeConfigured
 *        and surface a clean error) so the rest of the app runs locally without
 *        Stripe — mirrors the rate-limit / email fail-open posture.
 * WHERE: Consumed by src/services/stripe.service.ts,
 *        src/services/payment.service.ts, the billing router, and the webhook
 *        route. Client-side keys live in src/lib/stripe/*.
