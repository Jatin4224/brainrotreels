/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: organizationRouter
 *
 * WHAT:  Business logic + tRPC wiring for the bootstrapping queries the client
 *        calls before it knows which organizationId to pass elsewhere, plus the
 *        create-organization mutation used by onboarding.
 * WHY:   Runs on authProcedure (not protectedProcedure) — protected procedures
 *        require an organizationId input, which is exactly what these resolve /
 *        create. Handler bodies delegate to ctx helpers (active-org precedence,
 *        membership ordering) and to the organization service (org + owner
 *        member creation).
 * WHERE: Backed by ctx helpers wired in src/trpc/init and the organization
 *        service (src/services/organization.service.ts); mounted by
 *        src/trpc/routers/_app.
