/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: REQUIRED_ENV, RequiredEnvVar, EnvChecklistItem,
 *   getEnvChecklist, getMissingRequiredEnv, hasMissingRequiredEnv,
 *   OPTIONAL_ENV, OptionalEnvVar, OptionalEnvItem, getOptionalEnvChecklist
 *
 * WHAT:  Two lists: REQUIRED_ENV (the app CANNOT run without these) and
 *        OPTIONAL_ENV (fail-soft integrations like Stripe/Resend the app runs
 *        fine WITHOUT), plus helpers to check which are set.
 * WHY:   Drives the developer setup gate: the root layout renders a checklist
 *        instead of the app until every required var is present, so a fresh
 *        clone fails with clear instructions rather than a cryptic crash.
 *        Optional integrations NEVER block startup — they're surfaced on the
 *        same checklist purely as informational rows (purpose + how to enable)
 *        so a developer knows what's off and what turning it on unlocks.
 *        Only presence is checked and only labels/help/ok are exposed — secret
 *        VALUES are never read out, so nothing leaks to the client.
 * WHERE: Read by src/app/layout.tsx (the gate); rendered by
 *        src/components/global/setup-checklist.tsx.
