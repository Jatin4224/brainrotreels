/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: createOrganizationWithOwner, slugifyOrganizationName,
 *   ensureUniqueOrganizationSlug, CreateOrganizationResult
 *
 * WHAT:  Creates an Organization plus the creator's owner Member row in one
 *        transaction, deriving a unique slug from the name.
 * WHY:   The Organization/Member models carry no `createdAt` default and use
 *        string ids, so creation must stamp `id`/`createdAt` and reserve a
 *        unique slug — centralizing that here keeps the onboarding router (and
 *        any future bulk-provision path) a one-liner. Pure DB access only; the
 *        caller owns onboardingComplete flips and audit.
 * WHERE: Called by organization.createOrganization in
 *        src/trpc/routers/organization.ts; `db` is the caller's tx client.
