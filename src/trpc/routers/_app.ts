 * WHAT:  Root tRPC router that mounts every feature sub-router; `AppRouter` is
 *        the type exported for the client typed-hooks and the server proxy.
 * WHY:   Single composition point means new feature routers are wired by adding
 *        one line here; the type flows automatically to clients and the in-process proxy.
 * WHERE: Imported by src/trpc/server.tsx, src/trpc/react-provider.tsx, and
 *        src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts. Mounts routers from src/trpc/routers/*.
