 *
 * WHAT:  Barrel re-export for the `src/lib/config/*` modules.
 * WHY:   Single import surface (`@/lib/config`) so consumers don't depend on
 *        the per-concern split, and so the prisma singleton, branding,
 *        auth-routes, plans, and registration flag can be regrouped without
 *        ripple edits.
 * WHERE: Imported broadly across the app and by src/lib/better-auth/auth.ts.
