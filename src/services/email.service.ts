 *
 * WHAT:  The single transactional-email abstraction — renders a React Email
 *        template to HTML and sends it through Resend.
 * WHY:   Services only do one job; this one owns "turn a template + props into
 *        a delivered email". It fail-soft no-ops when Resend isn't configured
 *        (warns + returns a skipped result) so local dev runs without a key —
 *        Better Auth additionally logs the verification/reset URL in that case.
 * WHERE: Called by src/lib/better-auth/auth.ts (verification + reset hooks) and
 *        by the invitation router (src/trpc/routers/invitation.ts). Renders
 *        templates from src/lib/email-templates; sends via Resend
 *        (src/lib/config/resend.ts).

 *        can still complete an auth flow that is BLOCKED without the email;
 *        this message is a convenience, and the video is sitting on the
